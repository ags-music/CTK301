			<h2> About </h2>
			<p> Hello, my name is Anna and I'm studying audio production at ISU. I have played music for over half my life and started playing drums when I was 14. Now, drums are my favorite instrument to play, and I'm currently playing in a band. I also just recently wrote my first album and am working on finalizing that so I can record and produce it. I also have experience interning at a recording studio and am in the process of gaining my own recording equipment. Reach out to me for studio/live sound projects, booking shows, and artist collaborations! You can contact me at [email].</p>
